#Another Angular 2 + Webpack Starter Project

This is a starter project for using Angular 2 with Webpack and Express Js on the server. I have set it up more for myself to learn how to use angular 2 but I thought it could be useful for others who are trying to get to the grips with how to use the new version of the wonderful Angularjs framework.

The app is an ExpressJS application. It has routes setup to get to the index page of the app and to manage HTML5 push.

I am planning to try various available tutorials (like The Tour of Heroes) and publish the examples here.

Thanks to the [angular2-webpack-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter) for the inspiration and a good webpack + angular 2 example.
