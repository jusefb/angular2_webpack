#Another Angular 2 + Webpack Starter Project

This is a starter project for using Angular 2 with Webpack. I have set it up more for myself to learn how to use angular 2 but I thought it could be useful for others who are trying to get to the grips with how to use the new version of the wonderful Angularjs framework.

The app is an ExpressJS application. It has routes setup to get to the index page of the app and to manage HTML5 push.

I am planning to try various available tutorials (like The Tour of Heroes) and publish the examples here. So currently I have started going through "The Tour of heroes" tutorial. You can checkout my progress of the tutorial by running "gulp run --appName=tour_of_heroes" task.

Note: currently you have to manually add the html of your main component into the views/index.hbs file for the app to render.

Thank you to the [angular2-webpack-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter) for the inspiration and a good webpack + angualr 2 example example.

##In progress

- Add testing possibilities to the application.
- Add some examples from the ngBook to the repository
