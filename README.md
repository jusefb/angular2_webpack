#Yet another Angular 2 + Webpack Starter Project

This is a starter project for using Angular 2 with Webpack. I have set it up more for myself to learn how to use angular 2 but I thought it could be useful for others who are trying to get the grips with how to use the new version of the wonderful Angularjs framework.

The app is a Nodejs application (it has routes setup to get to index page of the app and to manage HTML5 push)

You can start the application by running "gulp" default task, which will launch the gulp development server.

Thank you to the [angular2-webpack-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter) for the inspiration and a good webpack + angualr 2 example example.

##In progress

- Add testing possibilities to the application.
