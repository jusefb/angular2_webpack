#Another Angular 2 + Webpack Starter Project

This is a starter project for using Angular 2 with Webpack. I have set it up more for myself to learn how to use angular 2 but I thought it could be useful for others who are trying to get the grips with how to use the new version of the wonderful Angularjs framework.

The app is an ExpressJS application (it has routes setup to get to index page of the app and to manage HTML5 push)

I am planning to try various available tutorials (like The Tour of Heroes) and publish the examples here. So currently I have started using "The Tour of heroes". You can start using the application by running "gulp tour_of_heroes" task.

Thank you to the [angular2-webpack-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter) for the inspiration and a good webpack + angualr 2 example example.

##In progress

- Add testing possibilities to the application.
- Add some examples from the ngBook to the repository
